SpendU is a personal spending tracker.

DISCLAIMER:

This app is indended to be a learning and experimenting project for myself. At this time, I have no intention of trying to publish this app. I am currently a student, with very little coding experience (basics of Python and SQLite, with a brush of HTML experience). My intentions are to learn through building this app. Through this project, I am continuing to improve python and SQLite skills. I am learning hosting, documentation, git, server management, and other skills.

This app gives users a clean, sleek homepage displaying the app logo, with date and time displayed, 7 day spending trends, and button links to other pages.

Features: Add spending and bill transactions View analytics Recent spending Recent bills Delete Transactions Futureistic UI SQLite database backend Fully mobile-responsive

Future Enhancements: User login and profiles Additions to analytics Dark/Light mode toggle Branding Budgeting tools
